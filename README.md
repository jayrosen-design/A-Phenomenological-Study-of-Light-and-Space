## Overview

This project explores the interaction of light and space through a phenomenological lens, analyzing how light shapes our perception of the environment. Presented at the **University of Florida Scholar Research Symposium** in 2013, this study investigates the transient and immaterial qualities of light as an artistic medium and its ability to create immersive spatial experiences.

The research culminated in a scientific poster that synthesizes artistic experimentation, conceptual insights, and phenomenological perspectives.
